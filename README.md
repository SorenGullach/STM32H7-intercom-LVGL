# STM32H7-intercom-LVGL
Based on the Riverdi RVT70HSSNWC00-B
This is my take on how to implement a shareddata between the CM7 and CM4 core on the STM32H7, It also use LVGL and HAL_FDCAN.

The code is based on the Riverdi STM32CubeMX exsample (https://controllerstech.com/lvgl-on-riverdi-stm32-h7-display/#google_vignette), and imported into two VisualGDB projects.
